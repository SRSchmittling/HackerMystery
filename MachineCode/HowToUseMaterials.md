# How to Use Hacker Mystery Materials

Whether you are a teacher/facilitator or a student doing this activity on your own, you should access the materials in this order:

1. Read the "HackerActivityDescription-Teacher" first. This gives an overview of the different documents and what they contain.
2. Read the "HackerAssignmentDossier" next. This describes your task. 
3. Read the "SillySimple_Architecture_Manual". This manual instructs you how Machine Code works. This is a simplified version designed for this assignment. Read the first part. Then, do the Worksheet and check your answers to make sure you understand how decoding machine code works.
4. Read the "SystemSecurityReport". This document provides intel on the hackers as well as the machine code that you need to decode to figure out the identity, high level language and location of the hacker.
5. When you are done, you can check the "SystemSecurityReport_Answers" to see how you did. Try to look to see if you got Phase 1 correct first, if you did, then look at Phase 2. If you didn't go back and see if you can figure out what you did wrong in Phase 1 and then double check Phase 2.
