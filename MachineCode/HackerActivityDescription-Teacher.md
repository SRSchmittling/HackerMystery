# Machine Code: How can computers do the things we tell them to?

## Focus Question
---

How are we able to tell computers what to do when we program them? Do they understand human language?

## Learning Objectives
---

I understand:
* What a machine learning instruction looks like
* That a computer uses the order of ones and zeros and a pattern to "understand" an instruction
* How to decode a simple machine code using rules provided to me
* what a register and memory are for and how a simple instruction set uses them.

## Materials
---

Each [group/student] should have the following:
* Hacker Assignment Dossier
* SillySimple Architecture Manual
* Clues 1-[99]

### Description of Materials
#### **Hacker Assignment Dossier**
Student is an Ethical Hacker approached by Snoodle Corp, a giant tech corporation, to identify the dark hacker who has infiltrated their computer system. The Dossier describes their mission if they choose to accept it, which they do.

#### **Hacker Name**
Students are ask to identify their Ethical Hacker pseudonym. A table provides a fun way to generate one. Students can follow the instructions or create their own using ideas from this document.

#### **SillySimple Architecture Manual**
This document provides information about how instruction set architecture machine code works. It also provides details on the SillySimple Architecture machine code.

#### **Clues**
The students will be provided with a list of possible clues. All are numbered 1-[99]. There are two rounds. During both rounds, students will decode machine instructions and implment them on paper. This will change values in the system's registers and memory (described in the manual). At the end of the round, the values in the registers will be used to identify a clue (1 in each round). The students will be able to identify the Dark Hacker's name, location and language they are using at the end of the second round.
