# Machine Code: How can computers do the things we tell them to?

## Focus Question
---

How are we able to tell computers what to do when we program them? Do they understand human language?

## Learning Objectives
---

I understand:
* What a machine learning instruction looks like
* That a computer uses the order of ones and zeros and a pattern to "understand" an instruction
* How to decode a simple machine code using rules provided to me
* what a register and memory are for and how a simple instruction set uses them.

## Materials
---

Each [group/student] should have the following:
* Hacker Assignment Dossier
* SillySimple Architecture Manual
* System Security Report

### Description of Materials - For Students
#### **Hacker Assignment Dossier**
Student is an Ethical Hacker approached by Snoodle Corp, a giant tech corporation, to identify the dark hacker who has infiltrated their computer system. The Dossier describes their mission if they choose to accept it, which they do.

#### **SillySimple Architecture Manual**
This document provides information about how instruction set architecture machine code works. It also provides details on the SillySimple Architecture machine code.

#### **System Security Report**
The System Security Report provides a description of the information that has been gathered by Snoodle Corp. It includes lists of possible Hackers, coding languages and hacker locations. It provides information on two hacks (Phase 1 and Phase 2). Students need to decode the machine instructions provided to get clues to the dark hacker's identity, language of choice and location.

#### **Glossary**
The glossary does what a glossary does. It provides definitions for some concepts in the lesson.

### Description of Materials - For Teachers
#### **System Security Report RESULTS
This document provides the solution to the mystery.
