# System Security Report

The dark hackers attacked our system in two phases at different times. We discovered the initial values in the registers for both phases before their commands were executed, as well as a list of commands they executed. 

We believe clues to their identity are embedded in the register values after all commands are executed. We seek to determine their hacker name, the high-level language they are using to implmement machine code on our system and the location from which they are completing their nefarious deeds.

We have narrowed down the possibilities through external intelligence:

Hacker Name | Language | Location
------------|----------|---------
**Bl33p** | C++++ | Mom's Basement
RayZ0r | Boa | **High School Computing Lab**
Hi-5 | **Arrrrr** | Corner Grab & Go
Whiskers | MochaScript | Evil Lair (aka hacker's bedroom)
