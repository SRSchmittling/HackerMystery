## Binary
---
Binary refers to the state of having one of two values. In our case, those two values are 0 and 1. Binary is also a system of counting that uses the power of 2. We generally count using a decimal system that is based on the power of 10. Decimal is composed of 10 digits: 0-9. We use a place holding system and powers of 10 to determine the value of a number. Let's look at an example, the value 126, which we know is 100 + 20 + 6. However, it is also (1 * 10^2) + (2 * 10^1) + (6 * 10^0). Recall that 10^0=1, 10^1 = 10 and 10^2 = 100. We can write numbers in binary the same way except we use the power 2 instead of the power 10.  For example: 011 in binary = (0 * 2^2) + (1 * 2^1) + (1 * 2^0) = (0 * 4) + (1 * 2) + (1 * 1) = 0 + 2 + 1 = 3.  In both cases the right-most digit is multipled by 2^0, and as you move left you increase the exponent by 1.
