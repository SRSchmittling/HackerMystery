# SillySimple Architecture
## Technical Manual


Computers seem mysterious, but in reality they only understand 1's and 0's where 1 represents the presence of voltage (think of a light-switch being turned on) and a 0 represents no voltage (the light-switch is off). While programming languages look readable to humans, in order for the computer to use them, they have to be translated into "machine code". Machine Code is a binary representation of the instructions (1's and 0's). 

### Machine Code
How does machine code work? Machine code works because it is the order and location of the 1s and 0s that provide info about what the computer should do.  There is a limited number of instructions the computer recognizes and everything we are able to do on a computer: we can do with these instructions. Very simple systems may have just a few instructions while more sophisticated ones have more.

### SillySimple Architecture
Snoodle Corps computer system is very simple and only has 8 possible instructions numbered 0-7. Instructions have different forms the provide the instruction with the information it needs to perform its task. 

In addition, the SillySimple system has two places where information is stored: registers and memory.

>Registers: there are eight registers numbered 0-7. These are locations that store numbers short term. They are sort of like a whiteboard where you can save calculations.

>Memory: memory is a place where data can be stored and retrieved. We do not perform calculations to values in memory. We must move them into registers first.
